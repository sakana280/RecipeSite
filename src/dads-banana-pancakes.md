Dad's Banana Pancakes, serves 4
===============================

Dad says these are healthy because they have more fibre and no added sugar. You can use up your old bananas or frozen bananas, which is a great way to avoid food wastage when your child repeatedly brings home a bruised uneaten banana each day in their lunchbox. Enjoy with maple syrup, fruit, butter, or sugar and lemon.
