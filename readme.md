# About

This site presents my favourite recipes in Recipe Grid format, similar to the Tabular Recipe Notation popularised by [CookingForEngineers](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/).
Recipes are specified using a [custom markdown notation](https://mossblaser.github.io/recipe_grid/language_reference.html) then generated into this website using the [static website generator](https://mossblaser.github.io/recipe_grid/recipe_grid_site_command.html) from [mosblaser's Recipe Grid v2](https://github.com/mossblaser/recipe_grid). [Examples](https://mossblaser.github.io/recipe_grid/tutorial.html) and [formal syntax](https://mossblaser.github.io/recipe_grid/grammar.html#grammar) of the recipe files.
